# Section 1 - Virtual Networks

### Using Pipeline automation
If not already done so, navigate to your lab repository created in the [Prereq](./prereq.html) section.
> 📣 Please follow the steps in that section if not already done so

Once you check in, following the Prereq steps, your pipeline will trigger and terraform will `init` and `plan` your code. You should now be able to review your plan from the Azure Devops pipeline.
> ❗️ Make it a habit to always review your terraform plan. Even if you think you know what's in it already

### Using Manual automation
You can execute the terraform command below from your local PC if you opted out of not following the setup steps. I strongly advice to take the automation route though as it introduces you to the Git repo and Azure DevOps pipelines and some other important concepts in Platform Operations.

*Note* You many run into permission issues using the manual process and would need to resolve it with your team members.

### Step 1

Run the following commands to confirm you are in the right repository (if running from your local machine)

```
az login
az account show
az account set --subscription DTS-SHAREDSERVICES-SBOX
az account show
```

### Step 2a
Run the following command terraform commands (if running from your local machine)

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply or terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Select `yes` to build resource as terraform will prompt you to approve you action if the `-auto-approve` is not provided
Log into the Azure portal and navigate to the `DTS-SHAREDSERVICES-SBOX` subscription, you should now have a similar resources created. Search for your resource group name

<br>

### Step 2b
If using the pipeline, a commit will `init` and `plan` your project. You can also optionally manually trigger a `plan` or `apply` from the devops UI.
In a production environment, its advised not to manually `apply` on master. `apply` should happen on merge of your PR.

Verify the following exist

- A virtual network (VNet) exist
- VNet has two peerings, one to the HMCTS Hub VNet and the other to the Core Management VNet
- A route table to one default route to `10.10.200.36`

#### What did i just create?
- A virtual network that's peered to 2 other VNets using the [vnet peering module](https://github.com/hmcts/terraform-module-vnet-peering)
  VNet peering is essential for communication between the various virtual networks.
  Most importantly, for network traffic to flow from the [Hub](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1511141283&__ncforminfo=ymJBSB3MQGJBph2cKEBJyqCsBFWvxnc2MHXLdaHv9ij45Z6HI42LhSPf1gMsfkZf5Z9pFf8NqzFbb6eCiIdJLJ3k6a0QAqQD) vnet where the [Palo Alto](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/) firewall lives to your vnet they need to be peered
- [Tagged](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/DTSPO/Tagging+v1) resources using the [tagging module](https://github.com/hmcts/terraform-module-common-tags). Tagging is an important part of the way we manage resources and is essential for managing running infrastructure and cost. This is enforced via Azure Policy and is defined in the [azure-policy](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-policy) repo
- A custom route table that routes all traffic to the hub. We operate a [hub and spoke](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1511141283&__ncforminfo=ymJBSB3MQGJBph2cKEBJyqCsBFWvxnc2MHXLdaHv9ij45Z6HI42LhSPf1gMsfkZf5Z9pFf8NqzFbb6eCiIdJLJ3k6a0QAqQD) model. All network traffic should pass through the [hub](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/ea3a8c1e-af9d-4108-bc86-a7e2d267f49c/resourceGroups/hmcts-hub-sbox-int/overview) for inspection before being forwarded to it's destination. In our [hub](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/ea3a8c1e-af9d-4108-bc86-a7e2d267f49c/resourceGroups/hmcts-hub-sbox-int/overview) we have
  2 active Palo Alto firewall NVA that inspects traffic and forwards it if allowed to the next hop which is usually another virtual network.
- A virtual machine without a public IP. We normally dont allow direct access from the internet to the backend resources. This has to ingress via a route which passes the hub and firewalls. This pattern is followed for most if not all resources or applications.
- A virtual machine that can be [accessed](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/DTSPO/Access+HMCTS+Bastions) via the bastions, as it does not have a public IP, because its been peered with the [core-infra-vnet-mgmt](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/ed302caf-ec27-4c64-a05e-85731c3ce90e/resourceGroups/rg-mgmt/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/core-infra-vnet-mgmt/peerings) vnet, it can be accessed via the HMCTS [bastions](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/b3394340-6c9f-44ca-aa3e-9ff38bd1f9ac/resourceGroups/bastion-sbox-rg/overview). You will needto be on the [VPN access](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1473556716&__ncforminfo=KrJ3_ABh6jWfksWuXyV3P0AVgDdrdldO1RMJDzjYyO2Y_8le-aWjrz_SqURx_CEKdqcwKxg6d_xZAN5A1vZizn230itnkRum).
<br>
Select the virtual network and copy the vnet address cidr e.g. `10.10.7.0/25` yours would be different if you used a different CIDR
<br>

**Assignment** 📕 If you want a bit of a stretch, notice that the vm's credentials are hard coded and checked into the git repo? That's a big no no in the real world.

You could try adding a [key vault](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/key_vault) resource that holds the vm's username and password and also use the [random password](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/password) provider to generate your vm's password.
Take note of [dependencies](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/dependencies), make sure your key vault and values are created first.

Happy Hunting!!!.

### Step 3

Checkout the [hub-panorama-terraform](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform) repo and create a new branch.
Navigate to [02-addresses-sbox.tf](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/configuration/groups/objects/address-objects/02-addresses-sbox.tf) file and add a new [address object](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-admin/policy/use-address-object-to-represent-ip-addresses/address-objects) called `labs-goldenpath-<yourname>` (example below)
<br>

```json
 {
   environments = ["sbox"]
   device_group = "sbox"
   name         = "labs-goldenpath-<yourname>"
   value        = "10.10.7.0/25"
 }
```

The value should be the cidr address space of your vnet

Next navigate to the [sandbox policy rules](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/configuration/groups/policies/security-policy-rules/02-security-profiles.tf) file and
create a new security policy with the following details

```json
  {
    environments          = ["sbox"]
    device_group          = "sbox"
    name                  = "labs-goldenpath-<yourname>"
    source_zones          = [var.zone_untrusted]
    destination_zones     = [var.zone_trusted]
    source_addresses      = ["any"]
    destination_addresses = ["labs-goldenpath-<yourname>"]
    applications          = ["web-browsing"]
    services              = ["application-default"]
    action                = "allow"
    disabled              = false
  }
```

The ordering of security rules *doesn't matter*, however we recommend you add this just after the `trusted-default` policy. This is telling the firewall
to allow traffic coming from the "untrusted" zone, internet traffic to your lab VNet in the "trusted" zone
<br>

### Step 4

Adding your new address object to the `G_trusted` group will allow your VNet to communicate with other VNets i.e. East/West network flows. For example, when you're logged in via the VPN you can ssh via the bastions to your virtual machine as both the bastion vnet and your new lab vnet are part of the `G_trusted` group communication is allowed via the `trusted-allow` security policy on the Palo Alto firewall.

To do this, navigate to the Address Group folder to [02-address-groups-sbox.tf](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/configuration/groups/objects/address-groups/02-address-groups-sbox.tf), add your new address object to the existing `G_trusted` group's `static_addresses` list e.g. add `labs-goldenpath-<yourname>`.

Example below

```json
 {
   environments = ["sbox"]
   device_group = "sbox"
   name         = "G_trusted"
   static_addresses = [
   ...,
   "labs-goldenpath-<yourname>"
   ]
}
```

🛠️ Commit your changes, add the relevant details to your PR, review any terraform plan, get approvals then merge

### Step 5

Get a [team member](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/DTSPO/Team+Structure) to review your PR, merge after you have reviewed the terraform plan and approvals have been received.
You can either request a specific team member to review or request everyone in a Squad or every in platform operations.
By default, 3 members would be selected randomly for you in most repos, you can set up Git [notify](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/sites/DTSPlatformOperations/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FDTSPlatformOperations%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2Fknowledge%2Dsharing%2FNotifications%2C%20pull%20requests%2C%20how%20can%20we%20do%20it%20better%2Emp4) to keep you informed.

### Step 6

Log into the [sbox Panorama Management](https://panorama-sbox-uks-0.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net) UI and verify your changes are in place.
Please note, you need to be on the VPN to access this resource. <p> To find out how to access the VPN read the [GitHub & VPN](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1473556716&__ncforminfo=KrJ3_ABh6jWfksWuXyV3P0AVgDdrdldO1RMJDzjYyO2Y_8le-aWjrz_SqURx_CEKdqcwKxg6d_xZAN5A1vZizn230itnkRum) confluence documentation.
If having issues logging into Panorama UI have a look at this [Panorama Walkthrough](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/sites/DTSPlatformOperations/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FDTSPlatformOperations%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2Fknowledge%2Dsharing%2FRedSquadKTSessions%2FPanaroma%20Walkthrough%2D20230302%5F100724%2DMeeting%20Recording%2Emp4&viewid=727d44f5%2Dc4fc%2D4adf%2D85a4%2D7a8742c25a00&parent=%2Fsites%2FDTSPlatformOperations%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2Fknowledge%2Dsharing%2FRedSquadKTSessions) session.
</p>

🛠️ Commit your changes, add the relevant details to your PR, review any terraform plan, get approvals then merge
<br>

#### What did i just create?
From the above entries you have created a security policy that allows network request flow through the firewall to your virtual machine
in your vnet. Without this rule your applications or services would be unreachable as they are not accessible from the internet by default


You should now have resources similar to the following:

  <details>
    <summary>Address Object Entry</summary>
    <img alt="Address object" src="./images/goldenpath-address.png" width="auto">
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Address Group Entry</summary>
    <img alt="Address group" src="./images/goldenpath-addres-group.png" width="auto">
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Security Policy Entry</summary>
    <img alt="Security policy" src="./images/goldenpath-policy.png" width="auto">
  </details>


### Step 7
Create an Azure Firewall [DNAT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-dnat) rule and checkout the [rdo-terraform-hub-dmz](https://github.com/hmcts/rdo-terraform-hub-dmz) repo

To add a new DNAT rule, navigate to the file [path](https://github.com/hmcts/rdo-terraform-hub-dmz/blob/master/env_tfvars/hub-sbox-int.tfvars) and add the following snippet. The name of this should be same name of your lab and IP of your apache server (in the virtual machine created in step 2).

Use the next available index in your case, you can find this resource in [sbox-int-uksouth-fw](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/ea3a8c1e-af9d-4108-bc86-a7e2d267f49c/resourceGroups/hmcts-hub-sbox-int/providers/Microsoft.Network/azureFirewalls/sbox-int-uksouth-fw/rules)

```json
{
   name : "labsgoldenpath<yourname>",
   palo_ips : {
   "uksouth" : "10.10.7.4"
   },
   port : [80,]
   index : 6
}
```

🛠️ Commit your changes, add the relevant details to your PR, review any terraform plan, get approvals then merge

Go to the Azure portal and review your changes in the [sbox-int-uksouth-fw](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/ea3a8c1e-af9d-4108-bc86-a7e2d267f49c/resourceGroups/hmcts-hub-sbox-int/providers/Microsoft.Network/azureFirewalls/sbox-int-uksouth-fw/overview),
this will create a new public IP address. You can verify your new IP by looking at the IP configuration (in the `IP Configuration` menu). On the right of
the firewall menu, you should see something similar to `fw-uksouth-sbox-int-palo-labsgoldenpathfelix-pip`.

Resources would be similar to the following:

  <details>
    <summary>IP Configuration</summary>
    <img alt="IPs" src="./images/ip-configuration.png" width="auto">
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Azure Firewall rules</summary>
    <img alt="DNAT rule" src="./images/az-fw-rule.png" width="auto">
  </details>
<br>

📣 Keep a note of the public IP address

At this point you should be able to access your apache server from your browser by using the default
DNS record created, which is associated with the Azure Firewall. The DNS record should
be similar to `http://firewall-sbox-int-palo-labsgoldenpathfelix.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com/` depending on your lab name.

### Step 8

When you add an endpoint to v2 Front Door, you will need to validate the domain using a TXT record.

In the portal, if you navigate to the frontdoor and go to `Domains`, it will say `Pending` beside your endpoint.

Click on `Pending` and you will see a record value. Copy this for when you add the DNS records below.

Create a Public DNS record.

Checkout the [azure-public-dns](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns)

Navigate to [sandbox.yml](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns/blob/master/environments/sandbox.yml) file add a new CNAME record using Azure Frontdoor url `hmcts-sbox.azurefd.net`

```yaml
  cname:
  ...
  - name: "_dnsauth.labs-goldenpath-felix"
    ttl: 300
    record: 
      - "<RECORD VALUE FROM ABOVE>"
  - name: "afdverify.labs-goldenpath-felix"
    ttl: 300
    record: "afdverify.hmcts-sbox.azurefd.net"
  - name: "labs-goldenpath-felix"
    ttl: 300
    record: "hmcts-sbox.azurefd.net"
    shutter: false
  - name: "cdnverify.labs-goldenpath-felix"
    ttl: 300
    record: "cdnverify.hmcts-labs-goldenpath-felix-shutter-sbox.azureedge.net"
```

🛠️ Commit your changes, add the relevant details to your PR, review any terraform plan, get approvals then merge

📣 **NOTE:** You will need to add all 3 entries to enable Azure Front Door verify your DNS record.

You should now see the similar entries as below

  <details>
    <summary>Public DNS entries</summary>
    <img alt="DNAT rule" src="./images/dns-entries.png" width="auto">
  </details>
<br>

### Step 9

Create a corresponding Frontdoor entries.

Checkout the [azure-platform-terraform](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform) repo

Navigate to the [sbox.tfvar](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/configuration/groups/policies/security-policy-rules/04-policy-rules-sbox.tf) file and add the below entry to the `frontends` property list

```json
  {
    product          = "labs-goldenpath-<yourname>"
    name             = "labs-goldenpath-<yourname>"
    custom_domain    = "labs-goldenpath-<yourname>.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net"
    backend_domain   = ["firewall-sbox-int-palo-labsgoldenpath<yourname>.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com"]
    certificate_name = "wildcard-sandbox-platform-hmcts-net"
    disabled_rules   = {}
  }
```

🛠️ Commit your changes, add the relevant details to your PR, review any terraform plan, get approvals then merge.

📣 **Note:** This resource takes a few minutes to complete, you can go grab a cup of coffee or tea

#### What did i just create?
A custom domain that matches to your DNS entry created above, a backend pool that frontdoor sends request to which matches
the public ip created above and attached to the Azure firewall and a routing rule that Azure frontdoor needs to process
your requests.

  <details>
    <summary>Custom Domain</summary>
    <img alt="Custom domain" src="./images/fd-custom-domain.png" width="auto">
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Backend pool</summary>
    <img alt="Backend pool" src="./images/fd-backend-pool.png" width="auto">
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Routing rule</summary>
    <img alt="Routing rule" src="./images/fd-routing-rule.png" width="auto">
  </details>
  <br>

### Step 10

Verify that you can

- Navigate to your url e.g. `https://labs-goldenpath-<yourname>.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net` and see your web server default page

  <details>
    <summary>Final result</summary>
    <img alt="Web Server page" src="./images/web-page.png" width="auto">
  </details>

- Navigate to the [Panorama management UI](https://panorama-sbox-uks-0.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net) and see your traffic logs.

  To filter the logs you can type in the below query in the search bar

  ```cmd
  ( addr.dst in <your-vm-private-ip> )
  ```

  Where `<your-vm-private-ip>` is the same as the IP on your virtual machine

  <details>
    <summary>Final result - logs</summary>
    <img alt="Panorama logs" src="./images/palo-logs.png" width="auto">
  </details>

  To learn more about Palo Alto firewall logs watch the [Navigating Palo Alto firewall logs](https://cjscommonplatform.sharepoint.com/sites/DTSPlatformOperationsTeam/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FDTSPlatformOperationsTeam%2FShared%20Documents%2FKnowledgeShare%2FHUB%2FNavigating%20Palo%20Alto%20firewall%20logs%2Emp4) KT session

- `ssh` onto you virtual machine by logging into the VPN and connecting to the sandbox bastion by running the command below

  ```cmd
  az ssh vm -n bastion-sbox -g bastion-sbox-rg --subscription DTS-MANAGEMENT-SBOX-INTSVC
  ```

  Once one the bastion `ssh` onto the VM using the below command

  ```cmd
    curl <your-private-ip>
    ssh labsAdmin2023@<your-vm-private-ip>
  ```
  <p> With the first `curl` command you should see the raw html output in the terminal to prove that you can reach your VM from the bastion VM.</p>
  <p> For the second command, accept the fingerprint prompt and provide the VM password, you should now be on your VM.</p>
