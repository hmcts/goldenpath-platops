AKS is a core service for the HMCTS platform. 
As part of the Platform Operations team you will need to understand:

- How AKS is deployed/updated/maintained: [Guide](https://hmcts.github.io/ops-runbooks/aks/index.html)
- How applications are built and deployed to AKS [Guide](https://backstage.hmcts.net/docs/default/component/golden-path-nodejs)

For this guide we will not being creating a new AKS cluster but we will deploy an application to an existing AKS cluster.
Use the application build/deploy guide to carry out the necessary steps.

### What did i just create? <br>
- An image of your application in the [Azure Container registries](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/bf308a5c-0624-4334-8ff8-8dca9fd43783/resourceGroups/cnp-acr-rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/hmctssandbox/repository) (ACR)
- A nodejs or java application running on the AKS cluster
- DNS record records as described above
