## Section 2 - AKS Cluster

There is a [Backstage GoldenPath documentation](https://backstage.platform.hmcts.net/docs?filters%5Buser%5D=all) for the AKS cluster which would walk you through the steps required in creating
applications in the AKS cluster.

Follow the steps outlined in there and this would build your application in the AKS cluster and also the DNS and Frontdoor
entries as described above.

### What did i just create? <br>
- An image of your application in the [Azure Container registries](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/bf308a5c-0624-4334-8ff8-8dca9fd43783/resourceGroups/cnp-acr-rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/hmctssandbox/repository) (ACR)
- A nodejs or java application running on the AKS cluster
- DNS record records as described above
- Azure frontdoor entries as described above
