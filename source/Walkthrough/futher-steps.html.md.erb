# Section 4 - Further Steps

Now that you have come to the end of this exercise, there is still alot more to learn.

You may have noticed that you built your terraform resources from you local machine. This is far from how things
are done in live environments.

As your next steps, you could

- Create a new Git repo using the code base as a start
- Update the configuration so that it does not try to `destroy` and re-create everything with every `terraform plan`. The key is the `local.prefix` variable
- Create a new Azure DevOps project under the [Platform Operations](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations) organisation.Check out this [blog](https://thomasthornton.cloud/) which has good content of Azure DevOps
- Link your Git repo to Azure so that subsequent commits trigger a build
- Set up backend state file for your project
- Create a 2 subnets with a `/26` mask and use one as the virtual machine subnet
