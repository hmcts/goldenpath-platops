# Prereq - CI/CD and SVC

If these terms are alien to you, this would be a good time to take a pause, grab your favourite beverage and have a read of the follow documentation

- [SVC](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git)
- [CI/CD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/apps/cd/azure/cicd-data-overview?view=azure-devops)

With that out of the way, the first thing we'll need to get setup for the labs is a pipeline as all your code would need to
run somewhere.

While we can execute our terraform code manually, as explained in the next section and mainly in lab environments or personal cloud accounts, we
advice that you stick to having your code in a git repo in your live environments.

This section will introduce you to our [Git](https://github.com/hmcts) repo and [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts) pipelines, we know you will need to visit Git and Azure pipelines like everyday so we
might as well get started with that.

## Lab Git Repo
Platform Operations uses Git for its source control. To create a repo for your lab, follow the steps below

- Navigate to the [HMCTS](https://github.com/hmcts) git organisations page. If you dont already have access you can
  double check the [Onboarding Checklist](https://turbo-fiesta-ov7yye3.pages.github.io/onboarding/index.html) to make sure you have the right access.
  You can also speak to a team member to assist if needed. [#platform-operations](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/archives/C01APTJAM7D)
- Create a new git repo. Call this repo `lab-yourname-goldenpath`. You can follow this convention in other sections of this exercise as this makes it easier to when cleaning up resources after the labs. Deviating from this naming through the tutorial will naturally cause issues as the name of the respository will may need to be referenced later on.

  🔔 In a production environment you will need to update your new repository's settings to allow merging to `master` | `main` only from a branch PR and also to require at least 1 reviewer for PR's created. You can
  learn more about this in the [Managing your repository’s settings and features](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository) documentation.

- [Clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) your new repo to your local machine as you will need this later.


## Lab Pipeline
You will also need a Azure DevOps pipeline to run your code. To create a pipeline, follow the steps below

- Create a pipeline in Azure Devops. In Azure DevOps, navigate to the HMCTS [Platform Operations](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations) organisation. On the `Pipelines` menu, click on `Pipelines`

      <summary>HMCTS DevOps Organisation</summary>

      <summary>Create new DevOps pipeline</summary>
      <img alt="Create new Devops pipeline" src="./images/new-devops-pipeline.png" width="auto">
    </details>

- Specify where you code repository is, in our case this would be Git

       <img alt="Specify Git repository" src="./images/new-devops-pipeline-2.png" width="auto">
     </details>

- Follow the relevant screens and prompts, select your lab repository in Git which would be an item in the repos listed after authentication
  is complete. To keep things tidy, place your pipeline in the 'golden paths' folder. You may see screens similar to the once below

## Build your resources
To get your resources provisioned,  follow the steps below

- In the [lab-azure-resource folder](https://github.com/hmcts/goldenpath-platops/tree/master/lab-azure-resource) copy all the files into your repo root folder.<br>
  Your repo folder on your local machine should now look like this

  ```markdown
  .
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── azure-pipelines.yaml
  └── components
      ├── README.md
      └── lab
          ├── main.tf
          ├── provider.tf
          └── variables.tf
  ```

📣 **NOTE:** You may want to modify prefix in your resource names defined in [main.tf](https://github.com/hmcts/goldenpath-platops/blob/master/lab-azure-resource/components/lab/main.tf#L3).
This will make them easier to identify, especially when there are multiple people doing labs at the same time. Ensure that the total resource name lengths do not exceed Azure limits, example:

```yaml
  prefix      = "xy-${formatdate("YYMMDDhhmm", timestamp())}"
```


- Commit and push to your repo. This will trigger a devops pipeline run.

#### What did i just create?
A lot has happened and is a good place to walk you through what's taken place so far

- If you have a look into the pipeline `yaml` file you will notice the following piece of config

  ```yaml
  resources:
    repositories:
      - repository: cnp-azuredevops-libraries
        type: github
        ref: refs/heads/master
        name: hmcts/cnp-azuredevops-libraries
        endpoint: 'hmcts'
  ```

  This loads a central template resource that used in all our repos to provide base or required functionality that most pipelines need, you don't have to configure certain functionality from scratch, you simply reuse.

  Have a look at the [cnp-azuredevops-libraries](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-azuredevops-libraries) repo to findout what capabilities this can give you in your other projects.

- You have all the terraform resource configuration that will spin up your lab resources

- You dont need to manually run or define `plan` or `apply` stages why?... yes, you guessed right, because it's already configured in the `cnp-azuredevops-libraries`'s [terraform](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-azuredevops-libraries/blob/master/steps/terraform.yaml) step.

  This is done by using the functionality as below

  ```yaml
  - stage: deploy
    jobs:
      - job: PlanAndApply
        steps:
          - template: steps/terraform.yaml@cnp-azuredevops-libraries
            parameters:
            ...
  ```

  and pass in the required parameters

- Thank us later 😉, you now have a default template that you can always use as a starting point on most repos you will create in the real world 😎.
