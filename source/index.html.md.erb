## About the Golden Path
The PlatOps GoldenPath's aim is to introduce our engineers to some key areas and technologies stack
that they most certainly will encounter on the project and also provide links to core repositories while walking you through some hands-on
exercise to get you familiar with them and the Azure portal.

### Core Repositories

- [hub-panorama-terraform](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform)
