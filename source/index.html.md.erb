### [Platform Operations GoldenPath Walkthrough](./Walkthrough)
The walkthrough will take you through some of our core technology landscape. We are certain you will need to be in
this space at some point and would like to introduce you to them.

There are hands-on exercises we'd like you to complete and trust you'll find them useful.

   
### [Technical Documentation](./Technical Documentation)
