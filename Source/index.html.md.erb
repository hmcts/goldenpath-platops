## Section 1 - Virtual Networks

<br>
Checkout [goldenpath-platops](https://github.com/hmcts/goldenpath-platops) repo, change directory into the `labs-azure-resource` folder and follow the below steps in order
<br>

#### Step 1

Run the following commands to confirm you are in the right repository
```
az login
az account show
az account set --subscription DTS-SHAREDSERVICES-SBOX
az account show
```

#### Step 2

Run the following command terraform commands
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
Select `yes` to build resource as terraform will prompt you to approve you action
Log into the Azure portal and navigate to the `DTS-SHAREDSERVICES-SBOX` subscription, you should now have a similar resources created

<br>
Verify the following exist
- A Vnet exist
- VNet has two peerings, one to the Hub and the other to the Core Management Vnet
- A route table to one default route to `10.10.200.36`
##### What did i just create?
- A virtual network that's peered to 2 other vnets using the [vnet peering module](https://github.com/hmcts/terraform-module-vnet-peering)
  VNet peering is essential for communication between the various virtual networks.
  Most importantly, for network traffic to flow from the [Hub](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1511141283&__ncforminfo=ymJBSB3MQGJBph2cKEBJyqCsBFWvxnc2MHXLdaHv9ij45Z6HI42LhSPf1gMsfkZf5Z9pFf8NqzFbb6eCiIdJLJ3k6a0QAqQD) vnet where the [Palo Alto](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/) firewall lives to your vnet they need to be peered
- [Tagged](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/DTSPO/Tagging+v1) resources using the [tagging module](https://github.com/hmcts/terraform-module-common-tags). Tagging is an important part of the way we manage resources and is essential for managing running infrastructure and cost. This is enforced via Azure Policy and is defined in the [azure-policy](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-policy) repo
- A custom route table that routes all traffic to the hub. We operate a [hub and spoke](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1511141283&__ncforminfo=ymJBSB3MQGJBph2cKEBJyqCsBFWvxnc2MHXLdaHv9ij45Z6HI42LhSPf1gMsfkZf5Z9pFf8NqzFbb6eCiIdJLJ3k6a0QAqQD) model. All network traffic should pass through the [hub](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/ea3a8c1e-af9d-4108-bc86-a7e2d267f49c/resourceGroups/hmcts-hub-sbox-int/overview) for inspection before being forwarded to it's destination. In our [hub](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/ea3a8c1e-af9d-4108-bc86-a7e2d267f49c/resourceGroups/hmcts-hub-sbox-int/overview) we have
  2 active Palo Alto firewall NVA that inspects traffic and forwards it if allowed to the next hop which is usually another virtual network.
- A virtual machine without a public IP. We normally dont allow direct access from the internet to the backend resources. This has to ingress via a route which passes the hub and firewalls. This pattern is followed for most if not all resources or applications.
- A virtual machine that can be [accessed](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/DTSPO/Access+HMCTS+Bastions) via the bastions, as it does not have a public IP, because its been peered with the [core-infra-vnet-mgmt](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/ed302caf-ec27-4c64-a05e-85731c3ce90e/resourceGroups/rg-mgmt/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/core-infra-vnet-mgmt/peerings) vnet, it can be accessed via the HMCTS [bastions](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/b3394340-6c9f-44ca-aa3e-9ff38bd1f9ac/resourceGroups/bastion-sbox-rg/overview). You will needto be on the [VPN access](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1473556716&__ncforminfo=KrJ3_ABh6jWfksWuXyV3P0AVgDdrdldO1RMJDzjYyO2Y_8le-aWjrz_SqURx_CEKdqcwKxg6d_xZAN5A1vZizn230itnkRum).
<br>
Select the virtual network and copy the vnet address cidr e.g. `10.10.7.0/25` yours would be different if you used a different CIDR
<br>

#### Step 3

Checkout the [hub-panorama-terraform](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform) repo and create a new branch
Navigate to [02-addresses-sbox.tf](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/configuration/groups/objects/address-objects/02-addresses-sbox.tf) file and add a new address object called `labs-goldenpath-<yourname>` (example below)
<br>

```json
 {
   environments = ["sbox"]
   device_group = "sbox"
   name         = "labs-goldenpath-<yourname>"
   value        = "10.10.7.0/25"
 }
```
The value should be the cidr address space of your vnet
Next navigate to the [sandbox policy rules](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/configuration/groups/policies/security-policy-rules/02-security-profiles.tf) file and
create a new security policy with the following details

```json
  {
    environments          = ["sbox"]
    device_group          = "sbox"
    name                  = "labs-goldenpath-<yourname>"
    source_zones          = [var.zone_untrusted]
    destination_zones     = [var.zone_trusted]
    source_addresses      = ["any"]
    destination_addresses = ["labs-goldenpath-<yourname>"]
    applications          = ["web-browsing"]
    services              = ["application-default"]
    action                = "allow"
    disabled              = false
  }
```
The ordering of security rules doesn't matter, however we recommend you add this just after the "trusted-default" policy. This is telling the firewall
to allow traffic coming from the untrusted zone, internet traffic and to your Vnet in the trusted zone
<br>

#### Step 4

Add your new address object to the `G_trusted` group and this allows your Vnet to communicate with other Vnets. For example, when you're logged in via the VPN you can ssh via the bastions to your virtual machine as both the bastions vnet and your new vnet are part of the `G_trusted` group comminication is allow via the `trusted-allow` security policy on the Palo Alto firewall.
   
To do this, navigate to the Address Group folder to [02-address-groups-sbox.tf](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/configuration/groups/objects/address-groups/02-address-groups-sbox.tf) . Add your new address object to the existing `G_trusted` group's `static_addresses` list e.g. add `labs-goldenpath-<yourname>`. 

Example below

```json
 {
   environments = ["sbox"]
   device_group = "sbox"
   name         = "G_trusted"
   static_addresses = [
   ...,
   "labs-goldenpath-<yourname>"
   ]
}
```  

🛠️ Commit your changes, add the relevant details to your PR, review any terraform plan, get approvals then merge

#### Step 5

Get a [team member](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/DTSPO/Team+Structure) to review your PR, merge after you also have review the terraform plan after approvals have been received.
You can either request a specific team member to review or request everyone in a squad or every in platform operations.
By default, 3 members would be selected randomly for you in most repos, you can set up Git [notify](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/sites/DTSPlatformOperations/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FDTSPlatformOperations%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2Fknowledge%2Dsharing%2FNotifications%2C%20pull%20requests%2C%20how%20can%20we%20do%20it%20better%2Emp4) to keep you informed.

<br>


#### Step 6

Log into the [sbox Panorama Management](https://panorama-sbox-uks-0.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net) UI and verify your changes are in place. 
Please note, you need to be on the VPN to access this resource. <p> To find out how to access the VPN read the [GitHub & VPN](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1473556716&__ncforminfo=KrJ3_ABh6jWfksWuXyV3P0AVgDdrdldO1RMJDzjYyO2Y_8le-aWjrz_SqURx_CEKdqcwKxg6d_xZAN5A1vZizn230itnkRum) confluence documentation.</p> 

🛠️ Commit your changes, add the relevant details to your PR, review any terraform plan, get approvals then merge
<br>

##### What did i just create?
From the above entries you have created a security policy that allows network request flow through the firewall to yourvirtual machince
in your vnet. Without this rule your applications or services would be unreachable as they are not accessible from the internet by default


You should now have resources similar to the following:

<details>

<summary>Address Object Entry</summary>

<img alt="Address object" src="./Images/goldenpath-address.png" width="auto">

</details>

<details>

<summary>Address Group Entry</summary>

<img alt="Address group" src="./Images/goldenpath-addres-group.png" width="auto">

</details>

<details>

<summary>Security Policy Entry</summary>

<img alt="Security policy" src="./Images/goldenpath-policy.png" width="auto">

</details>
<br>

#### Step 7
Create an Azure Firewall [DNAT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-dnat) rule and checkout the [rdo-terraform-hub-dmz](https://github.com/hmcts/rdo-terraform-hub-dmz) repo

To add a new DNAT rule, navigate to the file [path](https://github.com/hmcts/rdo-terraform-hub-dmz/blob/master/env_tfvars/hub-sbox-int.tfvars) and add the following snippet. The name of this should be same name of your lab and IP of your apache server (in the virtual machine created in step 2).

Use the next available index in your case, you can find this resource in [sbox-int-uksouth-fw](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/ea3a8c1e-af9d-4108-bc86-a7e2d267f49c/resourceGroups/hmcts-hub-sbox-int/providers/Microsoft.Network/azureFirewalls/sbox-int-uksouth-fw/rules)

```json
{
   name : "labsgoldenpath<yourname>",
   palo_ips : {
   "uksouth" : "10.10.7.4",
   "ukwest" : "10.10.7.4"
   },
   port : [80,]
   index : 6
}
``` 

🛠️ Commit your changes, add the relevant details to your PR, review any terraform plan, get approvals then merge

Go to the Azure portal and review your changes in the [sbox-int-uksouth-fw](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/ea3a8c1e-af9d-4108-bc86-a7e2d267f49c/resourceGroups/hmcts-hub-sbox-int/providers/Microsoft.Network/azureFirewalls/sbox-int-uksouth-fw/overview),
this will create a new public IP address. You can verify your new IP by looking at the IP configuration (in the `IP Configuration` menu). On the right of
the firewall menu, you should see something similar to `fw-uksouth-sbox-int-palo-labsgoldenpathfelix-pip`. 

Resources would be similar to the following:

<details>

<summary>IP Configuration</summary>

<img alt="IPs" src="./Images/ip-configuration.png" width="auto">

</details>

<details>

<summary>Azure Firewall rules</summary>

<img alt="DNAT rule" src="./Images/az-fw-rule.png" width="auto">

</details>
<br>

📣 Keep a note of the public IP address

At this point you should be able to access your apache server from your browser by using the default
DNS record created, which is associated with the Azure Firewall. The DNS record should
be similar to `http://firewall-sbox-int-palo-labsgoldenpathfelix.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com/` depending on your lab name.

#### Step 8

Create a Public DNS record.

Checkout the [azure-public-dns](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns)

Navigate to [sandbox.yml](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns/blob/master/environments/sandbox.yml) file add a new CNAME record using Azure Frontdoor url `hmcts-sbox.azurefd.net`

```yaml
  cname:
  ...
  - name: "afdverify.labs-goldenpath-felix"
    ttl: 300
    record: "afdverify.hmcts-sbox.azurefd.net"
  - name: "labs-goldenpath-felix"
    ttl: 300
    record: "hmcts-sbox.azurefd.net"
    shutter: false
  - name: "cdnverify.labs-goldenpath-felix"
    ttl: 300
    record: "cdnverify.hmcts-labs-goldenpath-felix-shutter-sbox.azureedge.net"
```

🛠️ Commit your changes, add the relevant details to your PR, review any terraform plan, get approvals then merge

📣 **NOTE:** You will need to add all 3 entries to enable Azure Front Door verify your DNS record.

You should now see the similar entries as below

<details>

<summary>Public DNS entries</summary>

<img alt="DNAT rule" src="./Images/dns-entries.png" width="auto">

</details>
<br>

#### Step 9

Create a corresponding Frontdoor entries.

Checkout the [azure-platform-terraform](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform) repo

Navigate to the [sbox.tfvar](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/blob/master/environments/sbox/sbox.tfvars) file and add the below entry to the `frontends` property list

```json
  {
    product          = "labs-goldenpath-<yourname>"
    name             = "labs-goldenpath-<yourname>"
    custom_domain    = "labs-goldenpath-<yourname>.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net"
    backend_domain   = ["firewall-sbox-int-palo-labsgoldenpath<yourname>.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com"]
    certificate_name = "wildcard-sandbox-platform-hmcts-net"
    disabled_rules   = {}
  }
```

🛠️ Commit your changes, add the relevant details to your PR, review any terraform plan, get approvals then merge. 

📣 **Note:** This resource takes a few minutes to complete, you can go grab a cup of coffee or tea

##### What did i just create?
A custom domain that matches to your DNS entry created above, a backend pool that frontdoor sends request to which matches
the public ip created above and attached to the Azure firewall and a routing rule that Azure frontdoor needs to process
your requests.

  <details>

  <summary>Custom Domain</summary>

  <img alt="Custom domain" src="./Images/fd-custom-domain.png" width="auto">

  </details>

  <details>

  <summary>Backend pool</summary>

  <img alt="Backend pool" src="./Images/fd-backend-pool.png" width="auto">

  </details>

  <details>

  <summary>Routing rule</summary>

  <img alt="Routing rule" src="./Images/fd-routing-rule.png" width="auto">

  </details>
  <br>
  
#### Step 10

  Verify that you can
   
  - Navigate to your url e.g. `https://labs-goldenpath-<yourname>.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net` and see your web server default page
  
    <details>img
  
    <summary>Final result</summary>
  
    <img alt="Web Server page" src="./Images/web-page.png" width="auto">
  
    </details>
  
  - Navigate to the [Panorama management UI](https://panorama-sbox-uks-0.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net) and see your traffic logs.
  
    To filter the logs you can type in the below query in the search bar
    
    ```cmd
    ( addr.dst in <your-vm-private-ip> )
    ```
  
    Where `<your-vm-private-ip>` is the same as the IP on your virtual machine
  
    <details>
  
    <summary>Final result - logs</summary>
  
    <img alt="Panorama logs" src=./Images/palo-logs.png" width="auto"> 
    
    </details>
    
    <br>

    To learn more about Palo Alto firewall logs watch the [Navigating Palo Alto firewall logs](https://cjscommonplatform.sharepoint.com/sites/DTSPlatformOperationsTeam/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FDTSPlatformOperationsTeam%2FShared%20Documents%2FKnowledgeShare%2FHUB%2FNavigating%20Palo%20Alto%20firewall%20logs%2Emp4) KT session

  - `ssh` onto you virtual machine by logging into the VPN and connecting to the sandbox bastion by running the command below
     
    ```cmd
    az ssh vm -n bastion-sbox -g bastion-sbox-rg --subscription DTS-MANAGEMENT-SBOX-INTSVC
    ```
  
    Once one the bastion `ssh` onto the VM using the below command
     
    ```cmd
      curl <your-private-ip>
      ssh labsAdmin2023@<your-vm-private-ip>
    ```
    <p> With the first `curl` command you should see the raw html output in the terminal to prove that you can reach your VM from the bastion VM.</p>
    <p> For the second command, accept the fingerprint prompt and provide the VM password, you should now be on your VM.</p>

### Section 2 - AKS Cluster 

    There is a [Backstage GoldenPath documentation](https://backstage.platform.hmcts.net/docs?filters%5Buser%5D=all) for the AKS cluster which would walk you through the steps required in creating
    applications in the AKS cluster.
    
    Follow the steps outlined in there and this would build your application in the AKS cluster and also the DNS and Frontdoor
    entries as described above.
    
    #### What did i just create? <br>
    - An image of your application in the [Azure Container registries](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/bf308a5c-0624-4334-8ff8-8dca9fd43783/resourceGroups/cnp-acr-rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/hmctssandbox/repository) (ACR)
    - A nodejs or java application running on the AKS cluster
    - DNS record records as described above
    - Azure frontdoor entries as described above
    
    
      <details>
    
      <summary>Final result - Application default page</summary>
    
      <img alt="Application default page" src="./Images/default-page.png" width="auto">
    
      </details>
    
    #### Points to note when going through the AKS steps
    
    - Make sure using <labs-YourGitHubUsername-nodejs> when configuring both Public DNS/Private DNS for Application
    - There maybe needed some troubleshooting e.g. library versions may be deprecated or need updating. 
    
    
    📣 **NOTE:** You need to be on the [VPN](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1473556716&__ncforminfo=KrJ3_ABh6jWfksWuXyV3P0AVgDdrdldO1RMJDzjYyO2Y_8le-aWjrz_SqURx_CEKdqcwKxg6d_xZAN5A1vZizn230itnkRum) to access the Backstage documentation
    <hr>  

### Section 3 - Clean Up 

   After completing the above steps you should tear down all the resources created. This
   saves the business money and helps prevent floating resources.
  
   <p>To roll back, do the following.</p>

   - You need to disassociate the PIP Azure Firewall created from the firewall
    
    <details>
    
    <summary>Azure Firewall disassociate PIP</summary>
    
    <img alt="AzFw disassociate pip" src="./Images/az-pip-remove.png" width="auto">
    
    </details>

   - If you ran the [labs-azure-resource](/lab-azure-resource) from your local machine, you have a local statefile. Execute the command below to tear the resources in your resource group
      
  ```cmd
      terraform destroy
  ```

 ❗️Make sure your account is still set to the `DTS-SHAREDSERVICES-SBOX` subscription as described in `Step 1` above

   - For all the other PR's created, create a new one removing only the parts you modified as part of this exercise, commit, review plans and then merge
   - Verify that all the resources no longer exist.
   <hr> 
  
### Section 4 - Further Steps 

  Now that you have come to the end of this exercise, there is still alot more to learn.

  You may have noticed that you built your terraform resources from you local machine. This is far from how things
  are done in live environments.
 
  As your next steps, you could
  
  - Create a new Git repo using the code base as a start
  - Update the configuration so that it does not try to `destroy` and re-create everything with every `terraform plan`. The key is the `local.prefix` variable
  - Create a new Azure DevOps project under the [Platform Operations](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations) organisation.Check out this [blog](https://thomasthornton.cloud/) which has good content of Azure DevOps
  - Link your Git repo to Azure so that subsequent commits trigger a build
  - Set up backend state file for your project
  - Create a 2 subnets with a `/26` mask and use one as the virtual machine subnet
